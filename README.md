===============

During the night between 2013 December 5th and 6th, the team .jSuisUn.pyVert will compete at the [Nuit de l'info 2013](http://www.nuitdelinfo.com/). This repo contains the result of our whole night.

During the niht, we tried to make intensive use of WebGL to model a fairground with ducks as the site's layout.

Technologies used:

* HTML5/CSS3/Javascript

* WebGL

* Blender for the 3D conception

(TODO: add libraries)
